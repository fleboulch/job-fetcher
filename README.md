## Information

### Lombok

Here I'm using lombok but in the real life I'm not a big fan of this library. Some upgrades of lombok can be challenging and sometimes there is conflicts with other libs (for example with Mapstruct). I prefer writing the good old POJOs by myself (with an IDE it's super fast)
